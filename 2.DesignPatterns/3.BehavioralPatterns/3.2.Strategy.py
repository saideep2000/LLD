# Problem Statement:

# In many applications, different algorithms can be applied to solve a problem, 
# but the choice of algorithm may vary based on the context or user preferences. 
# Hardcoding a specific algorithm into the client leads to a design that is difficult 
# to extend or modify. The Strategy Design Pattern addresses this problem by defining a 
# family of interchangeable algorithms, encapsulating each one in its own class. 
# The client interacts only with an abstraction (interface) for the algorithm, 
# allowing the underlying implementation to change without affecting the client. 
# This approach promotes flexibility and adheres to the open-closed principleâ€”systems 
# remain open for extension but closed for modification.

# Example: Transportation Strategy
# Consider the problem of choosing a mode of transportation to get to the airport. 
# Several strategies exist such as driving your own car, taking a taxi, or riding a 
# shuttle. Each of these strategies calculates travel time and cost differently. 
# By using the Strategy pattern, we can encapsulate each transportation method into its 
# own class and allow the client to choose the appropriate strategy at runtime.

from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

# Strategy interface: declares a common method for all transportation strategies.
class TransportationStrategy(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def travel_time(self, distance: float) -> float:
        """Calculate travel time given a distance."""

        # Cost is calculated based on fuel consumption: $0.15 per mile.

# Concrete Strategy: Taking a taxi.

# Concrete Strategy: Taking an airport shuttle.
