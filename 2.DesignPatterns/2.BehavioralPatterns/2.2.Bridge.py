# The Bridge Pattern is a structural design pattern that helps decouple abstraction from 
# implementation so they can evolve independently.

# It is useful when we have multiple variations of an abstraction that can be 
# implemented in different ways.

# When you have multiple dimensions of change (e.g., a shape can have different rendering styles).
# When you want to decouple high-level logic (abstraction) from low-level implementation.
# When you need better maintainability and scalability of code.
# When you want to avoid inheritance explosion (too many subclasses).
