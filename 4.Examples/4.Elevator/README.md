Design an Elevator System (Single Elevator): Outline the classes to operate an 
elevator in a building. Think in terms of an Elevator class, Request/Button classes, 
Floor, etc. A simple design might treat the elevator car moving up/down serving 
requests in order. This classic interview question evaluates how you handle state 
and behavior
At the SDE-1 level, the expectation is to cover basic functionality 
(move up/down, open/close doors) and manage a queue of requests, 
without delving into complex scheduling or multi-elevator coordination.
